Dear {emails["Names"][index]},
I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Avijeet Jain, and I am writing to express my interest in internship and Software Development Engineer (SDE) roles within your organization.

I am passionate about software development and specialize in building robust web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). 
I have experience with RESTful APIs and front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Additionally, I am skilled in UI/UX design, using tools like Adobe XD, 
Figma, and Sketch.

As the Chapter Lead of Google Developers Student Clubs and a core member of Abhigyan Abhikaushalam Studentsâ€™ Forum, I have organized and led numerous events
and workshops, enhancing my project management and teamwork skills.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and grow in a challenging environment. Please find my resume attached for your reference. 
I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with your organization's goals.

Sincerely,
Avijeet Jain
